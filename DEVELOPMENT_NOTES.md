# Development Notes

This document tracks the development process, key decisions, and technical solutions implemented in the Stripes VC Insurtech Dashboard project.

## Recent Updates

### TypeScript Refactoring & Bug Fixes (April 2025)

- Resolved type issues with react-icons integration:
  - Fixed IconType compatibility problems in Layout.tsx by importing the proper IconType from react-icons/lib
  - Switched to React.createElement for icon rendering instead of JSX syntax to avoid ReactNode vs Component type conflicts
  
- Improved chart visualizations:
  - Implemented overflow handling for Investment in Technology chart
  - Repositioned gap percentage labels in Technology Gap Analysis chart for better visibility
  - Added conditional rendering for small gap values to improve readability

- UI Refinements following Apple Design Principles:
  - Enhanced sidebar styling with consistent color variables and hover effects
  - Improved header component with better visual hierarchy
  - Added smooth transitions for UI interactions
  - Simplified section IDs for better code maintainability

- Code Cleanup:
  - Removed unused variables across section components
  - Fixed duplicate property declarations in style objects
  - Optimized chart rendering with conditional animations
  - Streamlined data processing functions

## API Integration Plan

For the future production version, we plan to integrate with real data sources:

1. Replace mock data with API calls to the insurtech data service
2. Implement authentication for secure data access
3. Add data caching mechanism to improve performance
4. Create endpoints for dynamic filtering options

## Performance Optimizations

- Implemented React.memo for chart components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Added virtualized rendering for large data tables
- Optimized animation triggers with useCallback hooks
- Reduced initial load time through code splitting

## Design System

We've established a consistent design system with:

- Color palette variables
- Typography scale
- Spacing system
- Component-specific styling patterns
- Interaction models (hover, focus, active states)

## Known Issues & Future Improvements

1. Remaining eslint warnings for unused variables in multiple section components
2. Need to implement responsive design for mobile devices
3. Add unit tests for chart components
4. Improve accessibility for screen readers
5. Consider implementing a theme switcher (light/dark mode)

## Development Workflow

1. Feature branches for new functionality
2. Pull requests with code review
3. Testing in staging environment before production
4. Documentation updates with each significant change
