# Development Notes Consolidation Practice

-   Added a new cursor rule for periodically consolidating development notes with a focus on identifying and emphasizing the most effective learnings.
-   **Consolidation Process:**
    -   Every fifth session, a comprehensive review of the development notes will be conducted.
    -   Key learnings will be identified, especially those that have demonstrably improved development outcomes.
    -   Each learning will be documented with:
        -   A clear summary of the original insight
        -   Specific examples of when applying the learning helped development
        -   An effectiveness rating (High/Medium/Low) based on observed impact
        -   Thematic tags (e.g., #TypeScript, #ComponentDesign, #Performance)
    -   A "Quick Reference" section will be maintained with the 5-7 most impactful learnings
    -   Learnings will be organized by category to build a structured knowledge repository
    -   Outdated or superseded information will be archived or removed to maintain clarity
-   **Benefits:**
    -   Creates an evolving knowledge base that prioritizes the most valuable insights
    -   Ensures development knowledge becomes increasingly refined and accessible over time
    -   Facilitates quicker onboarding for new contributors
    -   Promotes continuous improvement through systematic reflection on past experiences
