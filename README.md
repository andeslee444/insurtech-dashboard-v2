**Live Demo:** [https://andeslee444.github.io/insurtech-dashboard-v2/](https://andeslee444.github.io/insurtech-dashboard-v2/)

## Project Status

-   Successfully refactored from JavaScript to TypeScript.
-   Organized according to the structure defined in `STRUCTURE.md`.
-   Utilizes mock data defined in `src/data/mockData.ts` with corresponding interfaces.
-   Configured for automated deployment to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

## Tech Stack

-   **Framework:** React
-   **Language:** TypeScript
-   **Styling:** Inline styles / CSS (Potentially Styled Components, needs review)
-   **Charting:** Recharts, D3.js (based on dependencies)
-   **State Management:** Redux Toolkit (based on dependencies)
-   **Build Tool:** Create React App (`react-scripts`)
-   **Deployment:** GitHub Actions & GitHub Pages

## Development Setup

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Node.js (v18 recommended, see `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
    *   npm (included with Node.js)

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/andeslee444/insurtech-dashboard-v2.git
    cd insurtech-dashboard-v2
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install 
    # or `npm ci` for clean install based on package-lock.json
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will open the application in your default browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building

To create an optimized static build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates a `build/` directory containing the static assets. This build step is handled automatically by the GitHub Actions workflow for deployment.

## Deployment

This project is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages from the `main` branch using the workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

-   The live site is served from the build artifact generated by the workflow.
-   **Access URL:** [https://andeslee444.github.io/insurtech-dashboard-v2/](https://andeslee444.github.io/insurtech-dashboard-v2/)
