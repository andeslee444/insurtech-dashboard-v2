# Stripes VC Dashboard - Deployment Guide

## Server Deployment Instructions

This guide provides instructions for deploying the Stripes Venture Capital Dashboard as a web server application.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher)
- A server environment (AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku, DigitalOcean, etc.)

### Deployment Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd stripes-vc-dashboard
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Build the React application**

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with the optimized production build.

4. **Start the server**

```bash
npm run server
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in your environment variables).

### Deployment to Cloud Platforms

#### Heroku

1. Create a Heroku account and install the Heroku CLI
2. Log in to Heroku CLI:
   ```bash
   heroku login
   ```
3. Create a new Heroku app:
   ```bash
   heroku create stripes-vc-dashboard
   ```
4. Deploy to Heroku:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

#### AWS Elastic Beanstalk

1. Install the AWS CLI and EB CLI
2. Configure AWS credentials:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
3. Initialize EB application:
   ```bash
   eb init
   ```
4. Create an environment:
   ```bash
   eb create stripes-vc-dashboard-env
   ```
5. Deploy the application:
   ```bash
   eb deploy
   ```

#### Docker Deployment

A Dockerfile is included for containerized deployment:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t stripes-vc-dashboard .
   ```
2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 stripes-vc-dashboard
   ```

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured:

- `PORT`: The port on which the server will run (default: 3000)
- `NODE_ENV`: The environment mode (development, production, test)

### Security Considerations

The server is configured with security best practices:

- Helmet.js for setting secure HTTP headers
- Compression for improved performance
- Content Security Policy configured for the application needs

### Monitoring and Maintenance

For production deployments, consider setting up:

- Application monitoring (New Relic, Datadog, etc.)
- Error tracking (Sentry, Rollbar, etc.)
- Automated backups
- CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. Check server logs for error messages
2. Verify that all dependencies are installed correctly
3. Ensure the build process completed successfully
4. Confirm that the server has the necessary permissions to serve files
